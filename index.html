        <p>The computer programmer is a creator of universes for which he alone is the lawgiver.
            No playwright, no stage director, no emperor, however powerful, has ever exercised such absolute authority
            to arrange a stage or
            field of battle and to command such unswervingly dutiful actors or troops.
            -Joseph Weizenbaum

            <!-- So this is not a great way to reference an external file in code, because the server that this code
             will eventually live in is not your computer and here you are referencing your computer. So, whatever asset
             you intend to reference below should be inside a folder (best practise is to name that folder assets) within this
             project's folder and then you reference that file inside that folder in the src -->
