        <p>The computer programmer is a creator of universes for which he alone is the lawgiver.
            No playwright, no stage director, no emperor, however powerful, has ever exercised such absolute authority to arrange a stage or
            field of battle and to command such unswervingly dutiful actors or troops. 
            -Joseph Weizenbaum
